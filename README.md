# Getting started with Celonis Machine Learning
This repository contains example notebooks to illustrate the capabilities of the Celonis python package. The package allows you to pull and push data from your Celonis Data Models, as well as access your Analysis components and the Data Models themselves. For example, this allows you to join a new table that has been pushed to the Data Model to an existing table in the Data Model.
